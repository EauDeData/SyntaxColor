History[edit]
World War I[edit]
First formed on 29 August 1914, the brigade was initially made up from provisional battalions that were named after their province of origin, but these titles were replaced with numerals before the brigade arrived in Britain on 14 October 1914.[citation needed] On arrival in Britain, it consisted of four infantry battalions, numbered 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th.[1] As part of the 1st Canadian Division, the brigade fought in every major Canadian engagement on the Western Front between 1915 and 1918.[citation needed] Its first commander was Colonel Richard Turner.[1] From March 1916 until the end of the war, the brigade was commanded by Brigadier General George Tuxford.[2]
After training on Salisbury Plain in late 1914, the brigade moved as part of the 1st Canadian Division to the Western Front.[3] During its deployment on the Western Front, the 3rd Brigade fought in the following battles and engagements on the Western Front:[4]
