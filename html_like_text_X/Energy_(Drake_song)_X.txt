Composition[edit]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (September 2015)
"Energy" contains samples from Eazy-Duz-It performed by Eazy-E and Ridin Spinners performed by Three 6 Mafia. Energy was produced by Boi-1da and OB O'Brien. According to WhoSampled the song samples the score of an episode of The O.C..[1]

Critical reception[edit]
Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork gave the song a positive review and named it "Best New Track", stating "The song isn't aimed to any rappers or pop stars, not Kendrick Lamar, Big Sean or Tyga, but the song lines are dangerous."[2]

Music video[edit]
Release[edit]
The video of "Energy" was released on Apple Music and users with iTunes and registered Apple Music account can watch this video.[3]

Synopsis[edit]
The music video for "Energy" features Drake transformed into several notable celebrities, including: television personality Oprah Winfrey, during her famous interview with Tom Cruise; professional boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.; singer Justin Bieber, from a Calvin Klein advertisement; singer Miley Cyrus, from her own music video for "Wrecking Ball"; former mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford, enjoying crack cocaine in an alley; entertainer Kanye West, during the filming of his own music video for "Bound 2"; United States President Barack Obama, during a presidential address; NBA player LeBron James; and O.J. Simpson, during the high speed car chase that led to his arrest. In each of these iterations, Drake mimes along with the song. Interspersed with these clips is monochromatic footage of Drake and his entourage; along with portraits of other caricatures. Bookending the video, a child version of Drake is seen in a field with other children, who act not unlike bullies towards him. At the end of the video, the young Drake stands solitary in the field, while another child (who has now been revealed to have Drake's adult face) points a toy gun at him.[4]

Reception[edit]
Many critics stated that Drake uses this video to mock Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Kanye West and many other celebrities in the video.[4] However, each usage of a notable person is timed to emphasize a certain lyric within the song. None of the personalities parodied in the footage have publicly responded to the video for "Energy".[citation needed] Pitchfork Media named "Energy" the 12th best music video of 2015.[5]

Commercial performance[edit]
In Canada, "Energy" peaked at number 65 on Billboard Canadian Hot 100.[6] In the United States, it is the highest-charting song from the album to date, reaching number 26 on Billboard Hot 100, number 9 on Billboard Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs and number 5 on Billboard Rap Chart.[7] "Energy" also peaked at number 71 on UK Singles Chart.[8]
