Background[edit]
Electric Company: 1996 to 1997[edit]
Electric Company was formed when David Tan, Keith Colaco, Desmond Goh and William Lim Jr. got together to entertain for a fun fair at their neighbourhood church.  The band initially practised in an abandoned steel cargo container.  After three years of heavy gigging in the underground Singapore indie scene and developing a quasi cult status, the lack of support for local music and other problems forced Colaco to leave.  The band continued briefly as a three piece but disbanded a year later.

Reformation and first years: 2003 to 2005[edit]
In 2003, lead guitarist Daniel Sassoon of the now defunct Singapore indie band Livonia joined Tan, Goh and Lim . Soon after, the band's name was shortened from Electric Company to Electric Co., and finally to Electrico. Keyboardist Amanda Ling, the only female in the group, was talent-scouted by the rest of the band members and was the last person to join the band.
In August 2004, Electrico released its debut album So Much More Inside and their debut single I Want You which shot to No.1 on the then Singapore radio station Perfect Ten 98.7FM (now known as 987FM)'s official Top20 weekly countdown chart on October 2004, as well as radio station Power98.  Subsequent singles Runaway and Good Time were also considered big hits with fans and scored respectable positions on the charts as well.
To date, So Much More Inside has sold over 3000 copies at retail outlets and gigs.[citation needed]
On 26 September 2005, the band was nominated in the Favorite Singapore Artist category at the Quantum Mechanics, which was repositioned as a global benefit for the tsunami victims in December 2004. As a result, they made history by being the first Singapore band to be nominated at the regional music TV channel's awards.
Electrico played alongside one of the Philippines' biggest rock bands, Rivermaya, at the latter's first showcase in Singapore that took place at Bar None, Marriott Hotel in October 2005.
The band also performed live shows in the Southeast Asia region, including the Baybeats music festival in Singapore and the Pattaya International Music Festival in Thailand. The band opened for The Bravery when the New York-based band came to perform live in Singapore.

Rise through the Ranks: 2006 to 2007[edit]
After several months of promotions – with the band giving sneak previews of a few tracks from Hip City at a few of their gigs – the band was back in the studio to begin work on Hip City around August 2005. Initially scheduled for a late December 2005 release, it was later pushed back to 22 June 2006, due to several delays.
Love In New Wave, the first single off Hip City, subsequently went on to become Electrico's second song earned a No.1 spot on  the Singaporean radio station 987FM's official Top10 chart show on 22 September 2006. The session in which Love In New Wave topped the chart happened to have lead guitarist Daniel Sassoon as its guest co-host for the day. The single also later went on to top the charts in the Philippines.
The video for Love In New Wave was shot mostly inside Ministry Of Sound, Club Happy and at Haji Lane. It was directed by Carl Siahaan. Carl's sister, model/actress Desiree Siahaan made a guest appearance in the video.
Frontman David Tan revealed that all the songs in Hip City describe and reflect the current Singaporean music scene.
In November 2006, Electrico released their second single, a ballad called Hello which also can be found in the For Good! CD compilation that was released by Aging Youth Records in support of a Singapore-based charity, Music For Good, in April 2006 .
Love in New Wave charted No.32 in 987FM's Top100 Countdown of 2006. Electrico also won the Local Act of the Year (2006) accolade in 987FM's Top100 Special Category Nomination.
Love in New Wave also snagged the No.16 position in Power98's Top30 of 2006.
It was reported in Singapore's tabloid newspaper, TODAY, on 21 November 2006, that a special remix of Love in New Wave was done by Singaporean DJs Aldrin Quek and Akien, and that it became the latest dance anthem championed by British DJ Pete Tong on his high-profile Essential Mix series on BBC Radio 1 in England.[citation needed]
TODAY ranked Hip City seventh in their Top10 list of memorable albums that you should rock out to on stereos overall for 2006 . Describing the album as 'Simple yet melodic, Electrico's Hip City gave naysayers – who claim "Singaporean rock" is an oxymoron – a rocking slap in face' & rated Love in New Wave as a key track.[citation needed]
In February 2007, 987FM announced that Electrico's third single after Love in New Wave and Hello was to be We're Not Made in the USA. During an interview with 987FM's Muttons in the Morning on 16 February 2007, Electrico announced that as soon as they returned from their maiden USA trip, they would embark on an indefinite break to concentrate on writing new material for their upcoming still as-yet untitled third album.
A repackaged version of Hip City is currently available in Singapore music stores, containing two bonus remixes tracks of Love in New Wave with one from Aldrin and Akien Regroove and the other is the Tim Hudson Remix.
Hello debuts at No. 17 in the 987FM Top 20 weekly chart, the highest debut for the week ending on 23 February 2007. It reached its peak position of No.8 in the week ending on 16 March 2007 on the same chart. Eventually, it drops to No.19 in the week ending on 13 April 2007, and finally bows out from the 987FM Top 20 in the week ending on 20 April 2007.
On 26 February 2007, Singapore broadsheet The Straits Times reported that Electrico's break from the limelight was scheduled to be from six months to a year, and that they would return sometime in late March 2008. Lead guitarist Daniel Sassoon was quoted saying, " The break will give us time to recuperate, evaluate the band and write new material."
On 21 May 2007, The Straits Times's Sujin Thomas reported that Electrico won their 2nd Top Local English Pop Song award at the 12th COMPASS awards ceremony for Good Time.

Everybody's Here and the leaving of Daniel Sassoon: January to May 2008[edit]
On 23 January 2008, it was announced on Electrico's MySpace that Hip City is now available in The Philippines, Manila.
The band had uploaded a new song titled Everybody's Here on their official MySpace site.
On 10 March 2008, Electrico posted a message on their MySpace blog which revealed details of free exclusive download of Everybody's Here from 17 March onwards .
Everybody's Here is available for download on https://web.archive.org/web/20080321133124/http://www.everybodyshere.sg/. Lead singer David Tan said that the song was written for youths or anybody who feels lost, desolated, low in self-esteem, in despair, and all the negative things people face. Everybody's Here has been released on 987FM for the week 17 March 2008 .
The video for Everybody's Here is up and running on https://web.archive.org/web/20080321133124/http://www.everybodyshere.sg/ and also on MTV ASIA[permanent dead link]. The new blog MySpace message update was posted by drummer William Lim Jr. on 29 April 2008.
On 13 May 2008, The Strait Times's Sujin Thomas announced that lead guitarist Daniel Sassoon has called it quits with Electrico after being in the band for 5 years.[citation needed]
In a press statement issued by the remaining members, the band said, "With his demanding and gruelling career in the legal sector, Daniel had long wanted to take a break from the band to focus his energy on his legal profession."
Despite their loss, the band did not plan to look for a replacement and carried on as a 4 piece.
On 27 May 2008, The Strait Times announced that Electrico won 2 awards at the 13th annual COMPASS awards ceremony .
They were awarded their 3rd Top Local English Pop Song for Runaway and frontman David Tan was awarded the COMPASS Young Composer of the Year.
Electrico has been nominated for 2 categories in the 3rd instalment of Power98 Singapore Music Awards. They were nominated in the Best Singapore Band and Best Local Song for Everybody's Here.

We Satellites: June to July 2008[edit]
Electrico's 3rd album, titled We Satellites, was released in Singapore on 8 July 2008 . This album was less successful compared to their previous material. The lead single to be released from the brand new album is titled Save Our Souls .
On 10 June 2008, The New Paper announced that frontman David Tan has been awarded the Martell VSOP's Rising Personalities Award.

Leaving of Amanda Ling and What Do You See?: 2009 to present[edit]
On 8 June 2009, The Straits Times reported that keyboardist Amanda Ling left the band in May, and that she had engaged a lawyer to review the band's accounts.[1]
Electrico wrote the theme song What Do You See? for the Singapore National Day Parade, 2009, held on 9 August 2009 at The Float at Marina Bay to commemorate Singapore's 44th year of independence, and performed the song at the event. The lyrics were cited by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his 2018 National Day Message.[2]
The band performed at the One Movement For Music Perth (OMFMP) in October 2009. The band's trip to OMFMP was made possible with the sponsorship by GAC Events Asia, a company specialising in entertainment logistics.[3]
After a two-year hiatus, Electrico returned to play the Baybeats festival at Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay in June 2013. It was also reported that the band was working on new music.[4] The band also played at Music Matters Live.
In 2014, the band shared demo recordings of their new songs online. The songs, including "Eyes Wide Open", featured a more electronic vibe.[5] Electrico's set at the Good Vibes Festival in Sepang, Malaysia in August was cancelled after severe weather, and the band organised a "pay-what-you-want" fundraising gig at The Substation in October instead.[6] Reviewing the gig positively in TODAY, Kevin Mathews wrote that "the crowd was well into the performance — their enthusiasm certainly inspiring the band to give their best, despite some evidence of rustiness".[7]
