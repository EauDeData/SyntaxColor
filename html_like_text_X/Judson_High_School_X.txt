Judson High School is a public, co-educational secondary school in Converse, Texas, United States, 15 miles northeast of downtown San Antonio. It was established in 1959 as part of the Judson Independent School District, and is currently classified as a 6A school by the University Interscholastic League (UIL). Judson High School is the second oldest International Baccalaureate World School in Texas, since 1985. The school and the District were named after Moses Campbell Judson, who served on the Bexar County School Board from 1918 to 1939. His nephew Jack Judson was on the board when the decision was made to name the new rural high school Judson.[2]
For a portion of its history up through 2010, Judson High School used a dual campus system wherein juniors and seniors attended the "Red Campus" and freshmen and sophomores attended the "Gray Campus." Previous to this dual campus system, Judson also had an atypical structure because it only housed grades 10-12 with the middle schools supporting grades 7-9. These structural departures from a typical high school system were due to efforts to accommodate the area's rapid population growth.
A single building now houses all departments with the exception of the agriculture facilities. All original buildings that made up the Red Campus were razed in 2011 to make way for new athletic fields and tennis courts, and the Gray Campus was re-purposed into Judson Middle School. The Judson ISD Performing Arts Center (PAC), constructed in 1998, houses the band, choir, orchestra, and drama classes. The PAC facility has a recital hall that seats 216 people, and an Auditorium that has 840 seats. The Judson ISD Performing Arts Center is physically connected to Judson High School via a vestibule.
Judson was named a National Blue Ribbon School in 1999-2000.[3]
Before 2005 Judson was the only high school in the district. Karen Wagner High School opened in Fall 2005, and in Fall 2016 the district opened a third high school, Veterans Memorial High School.

Athletics[edit]
Judson's athletic programs have experienced state championship success in several sports.
Football
The Judson Rocket football program emerged as a perennial power in the 1977 season.[4] Judson won its first state championship in 1983.[5][6]
D.W. Rutledge coached the Rockets until 2000 amassing a record of 198-31-5 taking the Rockets to seven state championship games, and winning four state titles.[7] The football stadium is named after Coach Rutledge in his honor.[8]
After the 2000 season the team went to the state playoffs in nine of eleven seasons making three championship game appearances and winning one state championship.[9]
Mark Smith, formerly of Kerrville Tivy High School where he coached Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel, assumed head coaching duties at Judson from 2012 through 2013.[10]
Sean McAuliffe, an alumnus of Judson High School and its football program, became the head coach starting with the 2014 season.[11][12]
Judson offensive coordinator Rodney Williams became head coach in May 2019.[13] In his first season Williams led the Rockets to a regular season record of 9-1, but the team lost to Lake Travis 48-35 in the Region 4 Final, finishing the season at 13-2.[14]
Judson has made it to the playoffs 41 times over 58 total seasons, advanced to the state semifinal level 18 times,[15] reached the state title game 11 times, and won the state championship six times.[16]
Judson holds the all-time Texas state record with 43 consecutive winning seasons from 1977 through 2019. The team last finished with a losing record in 1976 and is a combined 456-103-5 during the streak.[17][18] The previous record for consecutive winning seasons was 36 set by Plano Senior High School. During the current streak, Judson has won over 80 percent of its games, and the worst record in 43 years is 7-5 with a worst regular season record of 6-4 (happened 4 times).
