The Canadian Green Building Awards are a joint program between the Canadian Green Building Council and Sustainable Architecture & Building Magazine (SABMag). The CaGB Awards are awarded annually to both residential and non-residential projects across Canada of excellent and innovative design and execution. Eligible projects range from new construction, existing buildings, interior design projects, and renovations and retrofits. Entry submission kits are available in January of every year, and the judging occurs in March. Winning projects are announced in May, and publicized in the summer issue of SABMag, on the SABMag and the CaGBC website, and at the CaGBC National Conference.[1][2]

"A very high-performance building that does justice to its client's corporate philosophy and aspirations. It includes some wonderful collaborative and social spaces. The project has been tailored to its inhabitants, offering up environmental features as a way to enhance their day-to-day working life. The green roof is not there just to gain a credit, but is a habitable program space for the enjoyment of employees."[3]

Sechelt Hospital Expansion and Renovations

Sechelt, BC

"This project is exemplary for its depth of integration at the community and social level. It is also an interesting exploration of how to improve clinical environments with operable windows, natural light and the integration of culture and community through works of art. Achieving such a high level of performance and at the same time strong connections to culture, nature and community is remarkable - particularly in a P3 project."[3]

Earth Sciences Building

Vancouver, BC

"A highly energy-efficient building that is also exemplary in its use of new wood products and technology. The facades are nuanced in their response to solar orientation and views, and the interiors are warm, welcoming  and beautifully lit. The project expresses its intentions very clearly in the arrangement of its program, the transparency of its activities and the high level of refinement in its detailing."[3]

George Brown College Waterfront Campus

Toronto, ON

"This highly accomplished and elegant building is notable for its strong relationship to site, its accessibility to the public and its 'porous' program of social space. The space flows freely between outside and inside, then through the building in a consistent and understated way. The high level of environmental performance is also achieved without overt expression of sustainable systems. A rare example of an institutional building that is also welcoming to the public and exciting to explore."[3]

Beechwood Deep Energy Retrofit

Toronto, ON

"A highly transferable example of how to intensify existing communities, adding to their capacity and improving their energy performance. The ambition to take this rather unremarkable existing house to an exceptionally high level of energy performance  is to be applauded, as is the suite of innovative but highly transferable strategies that were used. It is also noteworthy that the project team decided to build upward rather than outward, and to restore previously paved areas of the site to natural landscape."[3]

Jury Comments

Dura House

Terence Bay, NS

"An exemplary project that responds to the opportunities of its site, while respecting the rigours of the North Atlantic coastal climate. A compact plan, strategically placed thermal mass, airtightness 50% better than Passive House standard and a highly insulated building envelope make this a truly low energy house. Add to this the live/work configuration that will reduce transportation energy and the result is a compelling prototype which combines energy conservation, clever programming and contextual sensitivity."[4]

Fort St. John Passive House

Fort St. John, BC

"A highly commendable effort by a small and remote municipality to create a prototype residential building to the highest energy performance standards. One of the few single-family houses to be certified to Passive House standards anywhere in Canada, the educational opportunity this project represents is profound - and all the more remarkable because it is located in an area where the economy is dominated by the oil and gas industry."[5]

Grange Triple Double

Toronto, ON

"A flexible, multi-unit, multi-generational home that provides proof of concept for a new approach to urban intensification. The strategic approach to site planning, building massing, and programmatic flexibility simultaneously addresses the quantitative requirement for increased density, and the qualitative requirement to maintain the physical, social and cultural continuity of the neighbourhood. Passive and Active Design strategies combine to achieve a high standard of building performance."[6]

Our House

Toronto, ON

"A simple, strategic and highly reproducible series of interventions have completely transformed this modest residence into an appealing family home. Working within the constraints of a 450ft2 footprint, this project is notable for its compelling, well-proportioned spaces conjured out of an existing structure that was virtually unliveable. With close attention paid to airtightness, insulation levels and high-performance triple-glazed windows and skylights, energy performance has been improved by 90%."[7]

Jasper Place Library

Edmonton, AB

"The bold sculptural form makes this library an enchanting focal point in an otherwise visually unremarkable suburban community. The transparent facade and overhanging roof are part of a passive design strategy, while at the same time blurring the distinction between the interior and exterior of the building. The clear span concrete roof facilitates future reconfiguration of the program, while its undulating form serves to articulate interior spaces of differing character. Overall an engaging project that makes a vital contribution to the quality of community life."[8]

Groupe Dynamite Atrium

Montreal, QC

"Injecting life into a dead space between two large floor plate industrial buildings, this project achieves the greatest possible benefit to the company's employees with the minimum possible intervention. Despite the lack of an overt energy strategy, the atrium  addresses issues of community, light and air, wellness, material efficiency and building life cycle - all of which are key aspects of sustainability."[9]

Budzey Building

Vancouver, BC

"This public sector project is a model for energy-efficient high-rise residential design. The 30% window-to-wall ratio, the high-performance envelope with thermal breaks, radiant in-slab heating and heat recovery ventilation in each suite are strategies all private sector developers should try to emulate. This project is characterized by a remarkable quality and generosity of the interior spaces, making it an example of architecture that could truly transform the lives of its embattled residents."

Bill Fisch Forest Stewardship and Education Centre

Whitchurch-Stouffville, ON

"The first Living Building Challenge contender in Ontario, this benchmark project goes beyond net zero energy by meticulously pursuing a range of familiar conservation strategies including: a high-performance envelope with R-40 walls and R-60 roof; a window-to-wall ratio of less than 30%; and triple-glazed windows oriented for optimal solar orientation. A 35kW photovoltaic array contributes to the net positive energy result. Other notable achievements include net zero water, with rain and well water meeting 100% of occupant needs."
