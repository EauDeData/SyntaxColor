NCA[2] is affiliated with Brightmoor Christian Church, and was founded in 1986. The church and school moved from Southfield, Michigan, to a new campus in Novi, Michigan, in 2000. The school mascot is the "Warriors".
NCA competes in the Michigan Independent Athletic Conference (MIAC), and was red division champion for Varsity Men's Soccer, 2008; Varsity Men's Basketball, 2009; Varsity Women's Basketball, 2009; and Varsity Baseball, 2009.[3]
