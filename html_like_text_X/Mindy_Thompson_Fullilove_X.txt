Early life[edit]
Fullilove grew up in Orange, N.J. Her father, Ernie Thompson, was a labor organizer in Jersey City and was the first black field organizer hired by the United Electrical Radio and Machine Workers Union. Her mother, Maggie, was a white woman from Chippewa Lake, Ohio, who worked as a union hall secretary. Fullilove’s parents launched a successful campaign in Orange to desegregate local schools. She attended Unitarian Universalist Church as a child.[5]

Education[edit]
Fullilove graduated cum laude from Bryn Mawr College in 1971 with a BA in History. She received an MS in Nutrition from Columbia University in 1974 and an MD in Medicine from Columbia University in 1978. She received a Board Certification in Psychiatry in 1984.[6]

Career[edit]
Fullilove has been elected to the New York Psychiatric Society, the American College of Psychiatrists, and the New York Academy of Medicine. She is also a member of the American Psychiatric Association and the American Public Health Association. Fullilove was an Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the UCSF Center for AIDS Prevention Studies from 1983 until 1990.[7] She joined the faculty at Columbia University in 1990 as an Associate Professor of Clinical Psychiatry and Public Health, becoming Professor of Clinical Psychiatry and Sociomedical Sciences in 1999,[8] a position she held until 2016 when she joined the New School faculty.[9] She is a Professor of Urban Policy and Health at the Milano School of Management, Policy, and Environment at the New School.[10] There, she has been working on a project entitled 400 Years of Inequality, which examines events that have shaped inequality in the United States, going as far back as 1619.[11]

Other work[edit]
The CLIMB Project[edit]
In 2004, Fullilove helped start the CLIMB (City Life is Moving Bodies) Project,[12] a community-based initiative in Upper Manhattan that promotes physical, social, and civic activity among northern Manhattan residents[13] and is committed to ensuring parks are safe and accessible to all.[14] The project has sparked millions of investments, including one of $30 million in 2016 dedicated to updating Highbridge Park.[2]

University of Orange[edit]
In 2007, Fullilove and other community activists founded the University of Orange, a free popular education center located in her hometown, to promote civic engagement and active citizen participation in the community.[15] She currently serves as the university’s President of the Board of Directors.[16]

Interdisciplinary Research Leaders[edit]
Fullilove is a member of one of the fifteen teams assembled by Interdisciplinary Research Leaders, a program led by the University of Minnesota to build healthier and more equitable communities.[17] Her project, Making the Just City: An Examination of Organizing for Equity and Health in Shaw and Orange, is focused on helping people stay in neighborhoods that are facing the economic and social pressures of gentrification.[18]
