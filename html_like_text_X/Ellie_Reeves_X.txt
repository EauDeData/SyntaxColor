Early life[edit]
Ellie Reeves was born in Lewisham, the daughter of teachers,[4] Graham and Sally Reeves,[5][citation needed] and the sister of fellow Labour MP Rachel Reeves.[6]
Reeves grew up in Sydenham and was educated at Adamsrill Primary School and Cator Park Secondary School (now Harris Academy Bromley).[7] She has a bachelor's degree in law from St Catherine's College, Oxford.[8]

Early career[edit]
Reeves is an employment law barrister. She joined Labour at 15[4] and was vice-chair of the London Labour Party and a member of Labour's National Executive Committee. She is a supporter of Progress and Labour First.[3]

Parliamentary career[edit]
She was elected for the Labour-held seat of Lewisham West and Penge at the 2017 general election, almost doubling the majority to 23,000.
She was appointed PPS to the Shadow Secretary of State for International Development in March 2018.[9]
On 13 June 2018, Reeves and five other MPs resigned as frontbenchers for the Labour Party in order to vote in favour of remaining in the single market by joining the European Economic Area (EEA), defying party instructions to abstain.[10][11]

Personal life[edit]
She is married to John Cryer, chair of the parliamentary Labour Party.[3] She had a son in 2015, and another in late 2019.[4]
