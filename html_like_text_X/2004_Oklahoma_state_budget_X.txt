Overview[edit]
Fiscal year 2003 saw a $593 million revenue shortfall. For FY2004, as in most budget years, the top eleven appropriated agencies made up 90% of the total budget. For FY2004, the governor and legislative leaders imposed a 6.3% across-the-board cut to state appropriations from 2003 levels. Education, healthcare, human services and public safety agencies saw only minor cuts or even slight increases. More dramatic budget cuts (ranging from 10% to 20%) were made to the agencies in the remaining 10% of the state budget.
