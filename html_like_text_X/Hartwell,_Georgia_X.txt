Hartwell is located in the humid subtropical climate zone of the Southeastern United States. It is in the Piedmont Plateau region, along the eastern side of the Appalachian Mountains, at an elevation just above 800 feet (240 m). Due to some of the highest of elevations in the Appalachians being between Hartwell and Canada, this allows for slightly warmer conditions than areas further south such as Atlanta.  One exception to this rule is called the "wedge" or cold air damming. This is due to a large high pressure system in eastern Canada driving colder drier air down against the eastern side of the Appalachian Mountain range. When this phenomenon is joined by gulf moisture, it frequently causes ice storms or freezing rain in the region. This same geographical feature can also cause frequent drought.
Hartwell averages 51.96 inches (1,320 mm) of precipitation annually. The average snowfall is 2 inches (51 mm), although more can fall, and the city is just as likely to have no measurable snowfall in any given year. The 1993 Storm of the Century brought 6 inches (150 mm) of snow to the area.

Education[edit]
Hart County School District[edit]
The Hart County School District holds pre-school to grade twelve, and consists of three elementary schools, a middle school, a high school, and an academy school.[11] The district has 230 full-time teachers and over 3,564 students.[12]

Hart County Public Library[edit]
The Hart County Public Library was begun in 1938 with rooms over Homer Herndon's drug store, then moved to the County Courthouse in 1941 until 1968 when the courthouse burned down. It was then located in the County School Board building until funds were raised for a permanent building in 1975. [13]
