Career[edit]
Tuna is the daughter of Shaban Sejdiu, an ethnic Albanian former Olympic wrestler, who had won bronze medal in two Olympiads (1980 and 1984) for Yugoslavia. Tuna started singing at a very young age, participating in various festivals. Her professional career began in 2002 when she competed in the talent search competition Play - Search For A Star organized by the Macedonian record label M2 Production.[2] Sejdiu was one of two winners from the competition, which resulted in the release of her first single "Najdi den, najdi nokj, najdi vreme" (Find a day, Find a night, Find time).[3]
Tuna later began to establish her career in Albania and turned focus to releasing material in the Albanian language.  In 2003, she released her debut self-titled album Tuna, which was followed by her second album, S'ka me diktaturë (No more dictatorship), in 2006.[1] In June 2012, Tuna released "I Asaj" (Hers) which rose huge popularity on YouTube. Albanian newspaper Koha Jonë believed that the song would undoubtedly be a summer hit.  She released in November 2012 her 6th Album titled N.E.R.D.[4] In 2012, Tuna joined X Factor Albania as a judge.[5][6][7] She is a supporter of the LGBT rights.
