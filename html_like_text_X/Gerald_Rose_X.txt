		Gerald Hembdon Seymour Rose (born 1935) is a British illustrator of children's books. He won the 1960 Kate Greenaway Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book illustration by a British subject. The book was Old Winkle and the Seagulls, written by his wife Elizabeth Rose and published by Faber and Faber.[1]
Rose was born in Hong Kong. During the Second World War his father became a prisoner of war and his sister and mother were interned at Stanley civilian detention camp.[2]
He studied at Lowestoft School of Art and the Royal Academy.[2]
Elizabeth (née Elizabeth Jane Pretty) and Gerald Rose began to produce children's books, she writing and he illustrating. How St. Francis Tamed the Wolf was published by Faber in 1958. Gerald was a commended runner-up for the Greenaway Medal next year, when the librarians introduced the distinction, recognising Wuffles Goes to Town.[3][a]
In 1979 Gerald Rose won the Premio Critici in Erba in Italy for "Ahhh!" said Stork (Faber, 1977).
Rose lives in Hove, East Sussex.[2][when?]
