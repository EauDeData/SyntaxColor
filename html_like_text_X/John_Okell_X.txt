Life[edit]
He was educated at The Queen's College, University of Oxford, where he read Literae Humaniores ("Greats").[2]
In 1959, an inquiry about language courses through the British Foreign Office led to his joining the School of Oriental and African Studies as a trainee lecturer in Burmese: "They were looking for someone to be taught Burmese. I applied to the program as I was interested in languages and they chose me and trained me."[3][2]
At SOAS, he studied Burmese with Hla Pe and Anna J. Allott, phonetics with R. K. Sprigg and N. C. Scott, and general linguistics with R. H. Robins and Eugénie Henderson.[2] After eighteen months of study, he travelled to Burma, where he spent a year (1960–1961) immersing himself in the country's language and culture.[3][4] He returned for another year-long visit in 1969.[4]
He retired from SOAS in 1999, although he remains a research associate in the Department of South East Asia.[5] Since his retirement, he has continued his teaching of Burmese through short courses convened in a variety of places, most notably Chiang Mai and Yangon.[3][2]
In 2014, in the Queen's Birthday Honours, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to UK/Burma relations.[6][2]
In 2016, SOAS awarded him an honorary doctorate.[7]
He is the creator of the Avalaser Burmese computer font and the Chairman of the Britain–Burma Society.[4]
