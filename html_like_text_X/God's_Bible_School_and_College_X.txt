History[edit]
Originally known as God's Bible School, the college was founded by Methodist minister Martin Wells Knapp in 1900. It began as a diploma course, devoted almost exclusively to the study of the Bible and practical subjects. The goal of the institution was to enable the students to be effective workers in what Knapp called the "great, whitened harvest field." The original curriculum was called the Christian Worker's Course and in 1936 was standardized into a regular four-year collegiate course. At that same time, the Department of Education of the State of Ohio granted authorization to the college to confer baccalaureate degrees.

Academics[edit]
God's Bible School and College has three academic divisions (Education and Professional Studies, Ministerial Education, and Music) and offers both traditional and fully online education. Through these divisions twelve areas of study are offered. The college offers degrees at the associate's, bachelor's, and graduate level.

Accreditation[edit]
God's Bible School and College is authorized by the Department of Education of the State of Ohio to award associate and baccalaureate degrees and is regionally accredited with the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. It is also accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE).
The college is a member of the Greater Cincinnati Consortium of Colleges and Universities.

Facilities[edit]
God's Bible School and College has six major buildings. The Administration Building houses administrative offices, the Revivalist offices, faculty offices, and classrooms. The Deets-Miller Student Center houses a dining hall, student snack bar, Presidential Dining Room, a full-size recreation area, classrooms, and faculty offices. The Knapp Memorial Building houses a chapel, a men's residence hall, and classrooms. The McNeill Music Hall houses faculty offices, classrooms, and practice rooms. The Revivalist Memorial Building houses a women's residence hall and the Aldersgate Christian Academy. The R.G. Flexon Memorial Library provides shelf space for 60,000 volumes, student study area, offices, and archives.

Ministries[edit]
The college operates a K-12 Christian school (Aldersgate Christian Academy) and publishes the God's Revivalist.
The students of God's Bible School & College operate several inner-city ministries in downtown Cincinnati. They include the Main Street Chapel, Main Street Kid's Club, Laurel Homes Kid's Club, Mount Auburn Kid's Club, Teens of Power School, Teen Power, Teen Praise and Prayer Station.
