Sahakara Nagar is a residential suburb near Bangalore , India . It is situated on the outskirts of Bangalore. Sahakanagar is formed by Ministry of Communication Employees housing society and has developed to this extent under the efforts of Sahakaranagar Residents welfare association. Ever since the inclusion of 45 new wards to Bangalore city in 2008, Sahakara Nagar comes under the BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) limits. The locality is accessible via NH 7 on the East.
[1][2][3] Sahakara Nagar was formed in the early 1980s as a co-operative society for Telecom and Post & Telegraph employees of the Government of India. It has over 8 well maintained parks and two Playgrounds maintained by BBMP.
