Justine Fox-Young (born 1979) was a Republican member of the New Mexico House of Representatives, serving District 30.  She was first elected in 2004, and was re-elected in 2006. Fox-Young was defeated in 2008 by Democratic newcomer Karen Giannini.

Legislative career[edit]
In 2004, Fox-Young won a tough primary against incumbent State Representative Bob White to become the youngest sitting member and the youngest woman ever elected to the New Mexico Legislature.  At the time, Fox-Young was the office manager for attorney Mickey D. Barnett, a former Republican National Committeeman from New Mexico.[1]
Although Fox-Young initially earned a reputation as a moderate Republican, her vote on a controversial bill approving domestic partnerships caused some to view her as ideologically liberal. She was one of only two New Mexico House Republicans to vote for the measure.[1]
After the 2008 primary election, in which she ran uncontested, Fox-Young claimed to have proof of voter fraud in the Democrat primary races.[2]
Soon after, voters whose registrations Fox-Young claimed were fraudulent began to challenge her allegations. The government watchdog group Common Cause said her claims were "simply inaccurate." [1]
The American Civil Liberties Union sued Fox-Young for invasion of privacy, conspiracy and negligence.  All the charges against her were later dismissed.[3] 
[4]
[5]
In 2008, Fox-Young was defeated by Giannini for the House seat. The defeat came as a surprise to many, since the seat was viewed as a "safe" Republican seat.[1]
