V is the fifth studio album by Finnish singer Anna Abreu, released in Finland by Warner Bros. Records on May 30, 2014. The album was preceded by the lead single "Ra-Ta Ta-Ta" and followed by the single "Right In Front Of You". The album marked Abreu's first studio album in three years, following her fourth album Rush. It was also Abreu's first album released under Warner Bros. Records, which she signed with in 2012 after deciding not to renew her contract with Sony Music and RCA.
The album was produced by Jonas Karlsson, Jarkko Ehnqvist and Hank Solo, and features collaborations with Danish pop singer Christopher and Finnish rapper Gracias. The album debuted and peaked at number 4 on the Finnish Albums Chart, becoming Abreu's first album to miss the top two. However, the album continued to be a commercial and critical success for Abreu, being certified gold for sales in excess of 10,000 copies.
