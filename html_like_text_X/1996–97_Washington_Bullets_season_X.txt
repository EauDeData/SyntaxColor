The 1996–97 NBA season was the Bullets' 36th season in the National Basketball Association.[1] During the offseason, the Bullets acquired Rod Strickland from the Portland Trail Blazers, and signed free agent Tracy Murray. Despite a stellar season last year, Juwan Howard signed a 7-year $100 million contract with the Miami Heat. However, the deal was voided claiming that Miami exceeded their salary cap. The Bullets quickly re-signed Howard, but would lose their first round draft pick next year.[2]
With a record of 22–24 at midseason, the Bullets fired head coach Jim Lynam, then after playing one game under assistant Bob Staak, they hired Bernie Bickerstaff as their new coach. Under Bickerstaff, the Bullets finished the season winning 16 of their final 21 games. On the final day of the regular season, the Bullets defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 85–81 at the Gund Arena to capture the #8 seed in the Eastern Conference. They finished fourth in the Atlantic Division with a 44–38 record, ending an eight-year playoff drought. Chris Webber led the team in scoring, rebounding and block shots. He was also selected for the 1997 NBA All-Star Game.
In the first round of the playoffs, the Bullets were swept by the defending champion Chicago Bulls in three straight games. This would be their final playoff appearance until 2005. Game 3 of that series at US Airways Arena was officially their final game as the "Bullets". Following the season, the team changed its name to the "Wizards".[3]
