Biography[edit]
She received  a musical education in her youth (vocals, piano, dance school).  When she was 16 she entered the Vienna Academy of Music.  She debuted as Papagena in Mozart's Magic Flute at the Vienna State Opera.
After engagements at several theatres, she returned to the Vienna State Opera.  There, she heard the composer Nico Dostal was in search a leading singer for his operetta "Clivia".  On 23 December 1933, she took part in the premiere in the Berlin theatre on Nollendorfplatz.
On 30 November 1934, she sang the 'Lied der Lulu' (part of the five-movement concert suite version of Alban Berg's opera Lulu) at the Berlin Staatsoper Unter den Linden under Erich Kleiber.
In the ensuing period Lillie Claus focused increasingly on operetta. Nico Dostal wrote several of his operettas for her voice.

1933 Clivia (opera)[1]
1935 Die Vielgeliebte ( "I am in love")
1936 Prinzessin Nofretete
1937 Extra leaves ( "I forgot my heart away")
1937 Monika ( "Home Song")
1939 Die ungarische Hochzeit ( "I play the song of happiness and litter")
In 1942 she married Nico Dostal and retired from the stage.  Their son  Roman Dostal, later to be a conductor, was born in 1943 and the family lived in Salzburg. At Nico Dostal's 100th birthday celebration in 1995, the 90-year-old Lillie Claus Dostal was still in the best of health and participated in the events. She made several records.
