History[edit]
The most recent incarnation of the club formed in 1972 as Auldgirth Football Club playing in local amateur leagues. Auldgirth FC renamed to Blackwood Dynamos Football Club before a 1999 re-name to reflect their home ground is Crichton Hospital Park.[1] They were originally to adopt the title Crichton Royal Football Club, but never assumed the Royal part of the name. Their strip consisted of blue and white.
They formerly competed in the South of Scotland Football League, which they joined in the 1992–93 season. They won the South of Scotland League Cup in the 2002–03 season.
Manager Jim Thompson guided the club to their best ever season in 2007–08, as they won the league title. Winning the South of Scotland League gave the Crichton passage to the 2008–09 Scottish Cup. Having received a bye in the first round, they played Inverness side Clachnacuddin away in the second round on 25 October 2008, where they lost 1–0.
On 3 May 2015, it was announced that the club would fold after 43 years. This was due to their Chairman and two committee members leaving a committee which was already at the bare bones. In June 2015, it was announced that the club would merge with local amateur side Lochmaben Amateurs. The club played its home fixtures for the 2015–16 season at Hospital Park after a season playing away from their home ground. Before the start of the 2016-17 season, Crichton effectively folded as part of a merger with Lochmaben Amateurs and the club moved to Lockerbie and now play under the Lochmaben name.
