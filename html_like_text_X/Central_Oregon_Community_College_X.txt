History[edit]
Central Oregon Community College is the oldest two-year college in the state of Oregon. The college was originally founded in 1949 making it almost a decade older than Clatsop Community College, the next oldest Community College in Oregon. The main campus is located on the west side of Bend, Oregon on 200-acres.[6] The campus has a total of 26 different buildings, the most recently built being the residence hall in 2015. The location provides views of the Oregon Cascades, as well as access to lots of what Bend has to offer. The main campus is located near the Deschutes National Forest and Shevlin Park providing access to miles of trails and outdoor recreation opportunities. Central Oregon Community College also has campuses in Redmond, Oregon, Prineville, Oregon, and Madras, Oregon providing educational opportunities across the Central Oregon Region.

Academics[edit]
Central Oregon Community College provides students the opportunity to pursue an Associates 2 year degree or a Certificate.
