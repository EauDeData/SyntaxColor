		This article is about the swimmer. For the writer, see Takashi Hirose (writer).
Takashi "Halo" Hirose was a Japanese-American swimmer.[1]
In 1937 he joined the "Three Year Swim Club" of Soichi Sakamoto.[2]
He was the first Japanese American to represent the United States in any international swimming competition, and the first to set a swimming world record. He set that record in 1938 as a member of the United States’s 4 × 100 m freestyle relay team.[3][4] He also won the United States National 100m title in 1941.[3]
He would have competed in the Olympics in 1940 and 1944, but it was canceled those years because of World War II.[1][3] During that war he fought as part of the 442nd Infantry Regiment and the 100th Infantry Battalion, and earned five battle stars, the Combat Infantryman Badge and a Presidential Unit Citation.[4][2] He also had his legs temporarily paralyzed due to trench foot.[2]
After the war ended he attended Ohio State University, where he was an All-American three times, was an NCAA champion in the 100 free, and helped Ohio State win Big Ten, NCAA, and AAU team titles.[2] He graduated from that university in 1949.[4] He later became Hawaii's chief probation officer, and eventually retired in 1982.[4]
In 1987 he was inducted into Ohio State University's Sports Hall of Fame.[3]
He died in 2002 and was survived by his daughter Sono Hirose-Hulbert and his wife Kiyomi.[4]
In 2017 he was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame as a "Pioneer Swimmer".[3]
