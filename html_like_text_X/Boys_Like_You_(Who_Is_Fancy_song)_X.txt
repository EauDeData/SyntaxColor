Background and composition[edit]
Ariana Grande first teased "Boys Like You" via her Twitter account on November 10.[2] Over the next days until the release, all three artists promoted their song on social media. The song was commercially released on November 23, 2015, and was sent to radio on December 1, 2015.[3]
The song is a "swaying doo-woo pop number" that lyrically "hears the trio try to win the man of their dreams.[4]

Performances[edit]

Who Is Fancy performed the song by himself during the time when he was the Opening Act for Ariana Grande's The Honeymoon Tour.
The trio performed the song on Dancing with the Stars season 21 finale on November 24, 2015, following Meghan Trainor's performance of "Better When I'm Dancin'".[5]

Music video[edit]
The music video features computer cartoon animation. It starts with Who is Fancy swimming in a pool. The main point features him wearing a suit singing in front of a prison line while "Crossing the Line". Trainor is seen wearing a pink swim suit. After she is seen lying on a deck chair in cartoon form, she falls into the pool and is pulled out by the pool cleaner. She is also seen singing with Fancy in the prison in a purple dress.  Next, we see Ariana Grande (With very big eyes) in a white skirt in cartoon form baking a cherry pie for the pool cleaner. As she attempts to give it to him, he knocks her into the pool and she is rescued by him with his pool net like Trainor was. Next, we see her wearing a purple skirt with Fancy and Trainor in the jail cell. The video ends with Fancy being locked in the pool service truck by Trainor and Grande after Fancy blowing a kiss.

Chart performance[edit]
The song reached its highest international peak in New Zealand, where it debuted at number 34 on the New Zealand Singles Chart on the issue dated February 11, 2016 and reached its peak of 26 two weeks later. The song was certified gold in its seventh week on the chart for achieving 7,500 in equivalent single sales units. The song became Fancy's first, Grande's eighth, and Trainor's sixth charting single in the country.
