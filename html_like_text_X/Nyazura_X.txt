Nyazura (formerly Inyazura) (the locals call it Nyazure) is the second largest urban settlement in Makoni District in the province of Manicaland, Zimbabwe located 72 km north-west of Mutare on the main road and railway linking Harare and Mutare. The settlement is named after the Nyazure River which is a tributary of the Save River. The phosphate from Dorowa (to the south-west) are handled by the railways here.

History[edit]
Inyazura was in the time of steam traction a so-called booking-off depot. Salisbury (now Harare) based traincrews would book off at Inyazura (better known by traincrews as IY) and Inyazura based traincrews would then work the Umtali/Beira trains onwards to Umtali (now Mutare).
After the laid down booking off period (usually 12 hours) the rested Salisbury crews would then take the Saisbury bound trains back to their home depot.
When diesel traction was introduced on the Salisbury-Umtali section (early 1950s) the booking off system was phased out, Inyazura was closed as a re-crewing depot, and the so-called round trip working was introduced whereby Salisbury  train crews met up with the Umtali train crews at a booked change over place (usually Eagles Nest siding) where the crews handed over trains and locomotives to each other and then returned to their own home depots.

Economy[edit]
In addition to being a booking off station for the railways, Nyazure developed into a service center for the commercial farming enterprises that were developed around it in the 1950s. The old "Farmers Co-op" store (referred to as "Big Store") was constructed in this period and continued to serve as the farmers' supply center well into the 1980s. Over the same period, Nyazure became the administrative center for Tsungwesi Rural Council which served the then Commercial farming sector. From the 1950s to the 1960s Nyazure was the base for the Margolis family's trading enterprise which extended over most of Chiduku and Buhera Tribal Trust Lands (Communal Lands) where they purchased grain and groundnuts from the small scale growers. Most of the buildings in the settlement were developed during this period. The development of the Harare-Mutare By-pass to the east of the settlement in the 1960s appeared to have taken the "wind out of the settlement's life" as road traffic which used to pass through it was diverted away. Most of the services that were previously provided from the settlement could also be provided from Rusape.
New life has been injected into Nyazure over the past twenty years with the designation of agro-residential plots and a new residential suburb to the south of the settlement. A Central Business District (CBD) has also been designated between the old settlement and the main Harare-Mutare road. A number of private entrepreneurs have already started developing various business outlets in the area. The settlement also serves a much larger farming population following the land redistribution programme which has seen all the commercial farming properties around it sub-dived to accommodate previously landless locals.
