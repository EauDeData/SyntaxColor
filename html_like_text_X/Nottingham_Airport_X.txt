Nottingham Airport (IATA: NQT, ICAO: EGBN), also known as Nottingham City Airport,[2] is located in Tollerton, Nottinghamshire, England. It is situated 3 nautical miles (5.6 km; 3.5 mi) south east[1] of Nottingham City Centre, and signposted on the A52 at Trent Bridge and on the A606—this makes it one of the closest airports to a city centre in the UK. The aerodrome is equipped for private aviation, business aviation and flight instruction. 
The airport primarily serves general aviation and has two runways: 09/27 and 03/21 which are 1,050 m × 30 m (3,445 ft × 98 ft) and 821 m × 23 m (2,694 ft × 75 ft) respectively. The longer runway is equipped with lighting for night flying, which operates during the winter flying season.
Nottingham City Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P491) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Truman Aviation Limited).[3]

History[edit]
Nottingham (Tollerton) Airport was opened in 1930 for civilian aviation. During the Second World War, the airport was known as RAF Tollerton and acted as a relief landing ground for the Polish Training School based at RAF Newton for the Polish Air Force, and was host to Field Aircraft Services, which repaired battle damaged heavy aircraft and later dismantled them. 
After the war the airfield returned to civilian use including a short lived period as a commercial airport, with Blue Line Airways operating from there until 1949, when its aircraft passed on to British Eagle Since that time, Tollerton has serviced small private aircraft only, this has included hosting airshows and three King's Cup Air Races 1967, 1968, and 1970.
The 227-acre (0.92 km2) airport was purchased in December 2006 from Nottingham City Council, by a consortium called Nottingham City Airport plc., and a programme of improvement was promised.
A comprehensive history of the airfield titled 'Tollerton - An Airfield For Nottingham 1929-2007' was published by the Keyworth and District Local History Society in 2008.

Truman Aviation[edit]
Truman Aviation is the airport operator, as well as a flight training organisation. It incorporates its own maintenance organization, flight training school and flying club; it is also responsible for providing Air Traffic Services, Fire and Rescue Services and handling on the aerodrome. Truman Aviation operates a fleet of ten aircraft, including the Piper PA-38 Tomahawk, Piper PA-28 Archer, Piper PA-28 Arrow, Piper PA-34 Seneca, Cessna 172 and a Tiger Moth.

Sherwood Flying Club[edit]
Sherwood Flying Club is a members only flying club, based at Nottingham Airport. It was founded in 1957 and presently uses two Piper PA-28 Cherokees and two Grob G-115s for hire and training.

2425 (Nottingham Airport Squadron) Air Training Corps[edit]
2425 Squadron has been based at the airport since the early 1980s. This thriving Squadron is one of around 1,000 Squadrons that form the Air Training Corps or RAF Air Cadets. Cadets are from Tollerton and the surrounding suburbs and villages within a 10-mile radius approximately.
