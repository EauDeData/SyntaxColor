Club career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Parr was born in Oslo where he grew up in Holmlia and played for Holmlia SK. During his youth he also played for KFUM Oslo and Hauger before he got enrolled in the NTG/Lyn-program.
Parr made his Tippeligaen debut for Lyn on 30 April 2006, in a 1–4 loss against Stabæk. He played 14 senior matches for Lyn, 11 of them in Tippeligaen. Parr was mostly used as a striker or winger at Lyn.
In March 2007 he signed a three-year contract for Aalesund. He was in the starting line-up five times, and came off the bench 14 times during his first year in Aalesund. His first league goal came in the 4–1 victory against Sandefjord on 29 July 2007. He won the Norwegian Football Cup with Aalesund in 2009. In February 2010, he extended his contract an extra year, expiring at the end of 2011.

Crystal Palace[edit]
On 16 July 2011, Aalesund agreed a fee for Parr to transfer to London-based Championship side Crystal Palace, subject to a medical.[1] Three days later, Crystal Palace confirmed that Parr had signed a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee.[2] on 24 January 2012, Parr missed the final penalty when Crystal Palace lost a penalty shoot-out 1–3 against Cardiff City in the semi final of the 2011–12 League Cup.[3] On 12 May 2012, he was voted Crystal Palace player of the year for the 2011–12 season, due to his work-ethic and his great fitness.
Parr started the 2012–13 season well, and made the left-back position his own in Dougie Freedman's team. After Freedman's acrimonious departure from Selhurst Park in October, Parr's place in the starting XI was never under threat. New manager Ian Holloway had to also deploy him in the right fullback position because of injuries. Parr's season ended in April against Ipswich Town after damaging ligaments in his ankle. Nevertheless, Crystal Palace still managed to gain promotion to the Premier League at the end of the season. The Eagles beat Watford in the promotion-playoffs finals to return to the English top tier after an eight-year absence.
When Parr returned from his ankle-injury, Dean Moxey was the preferred choice as Palace's left-back.[4] Parr got his Premier League debut for Crystal Palace on 21 December, replacing left-back rival Dean Moxey at half time in the match against Newcastle United. Parr gave away a penalty in his first appearance in eight months.[5] Parr then started the next eight matches for Palace under the new manager Tony Pulis, before he was injured in the FA Cup fourth-round match against Wigan Athletic on 25 January 2014. Palace lost the match 1–2.[4]
At the end of 2013–14 season, he was released by the club.[6]

Ipswich Town[edit]
On 7 July 2014, Parr signed for Ipswich Town on a free transfer. The 25-year-old Norway international signed a two-year deal.[7]
Parr scored his first goal for Ipswich against Brighton and Hove Albion on Tuesday 16 September 2014.

Strømsgodset[edit]
Parr signed a permanent deal with Strømsgodset on 13 January 2016.[8] He signed a 3.5-year contract.

International career[edit]
Parr played 14 games on national youth teams for Norway up to U-19, and was a regular at the Norway national under-21 football team with 18 matches between 2008 and 2010. On 11 May 2010, he got selected for the senior national team for the first time, as Norway were facing Montenegro and Ukraine.[9][10]
Parr debuted on the Norway national team on 29 May 2010, in a friendly match against Montenegro, and he became Aalesund's first player to have started a Norway national game.[11] As of February 2013, Parr has been capped nine times.
