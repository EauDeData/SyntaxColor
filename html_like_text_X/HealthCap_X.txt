History[edit]
The firm was founded in 1996 by Björn Odlander[3]  and Peder Fredrikson,[4] and the first fund was started the same year. As of 2017, HealthCap has established seven funds and financed 106 companies, where 39 have been taken public on nine different markets. The most recent fund, HealthCap VII, was established in the fall of 2015.
In 2017, HealthCap had approximately 23 employees out of which ten are partners. The team combines venture capital investing experience with competencies and work experiences from small as well as large companies across the healthcare industry, spanning disciplines of scientific research, drug development, clinical practice, investment banking, and industry management.
