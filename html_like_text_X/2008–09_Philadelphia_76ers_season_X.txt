The 2008–09 Philadelphia 76ers season was the 70th season of the franchise, 60th in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team finished with a .500 record.
The only two things memorable about the season is that the team went back to the classic uniform style the team wore in the 1980s, and the Sixers defeated the Chicago Bulls in a game played at The Spectrum, the teams home from 1967–1996.
The team signed Elton Brand to a 5-year $79 million dollar contract.

Free Agency[edit]
The Sixers headed into the off-season with free agents Louis Amundson, Calvin Booth, Herbert Hill, Andre Iguodala, Kevin Ollie, Shavlik Randolph and Louis Williams.
On June 24, the Sixers extended qualifying offers to key restricted free agents Andre Iguodala and Louis Williams. The Sixers brought in Atlanta Hawks restricted free agent Josh Smith  on July 3 for a tour of Philadelphia but left the city without signing an offer sheet.[1]
On July 9 after denouncing their rights to their unrestricted free agents,[2] and trading Rodney Carney and Calvin Booth,[3] the Sixers signed 2-time NBA All-Star Power Forward Elton Brand of the Los Angeles Clippers to a 5-year contract reportedly worth 78–82 Million dollars.[4]
After the Brand signing, the first weeks of July were quiet in terms of free agency. Rumors spread that key restricted free agents Andre Iguodala and Louis Williams were being pursued by the Los Angeles Clippers and Golden State Warriors respectively.
On July 24 it was announced by Philly.com that the Sixers had come to terms with Point Guard Royal Ivey of the Milwaukee Bucks for a 2-year league minimum contract. The deal was finalized and signed on Monday July 28.
Also on July 28, Philly.com released that the Sixers had come to terms with Shooting Guard Kareem Rush of the Indiana Pacers. The deal was finalized and signed on Tuesday July 29.[5]
After news reports stated that Louis Williams rejected a $3.9M deal from the Sixers and he was talking to the Cleveland Cavaliers,[6] he signed a 5-year deal on July 31.[7]
On August 12, ESPN announced that the 76ers had come to terms with restricted free agent Andre Iguodala on a reported 6-year 80 million dollar deal.[8] After several days, it was officially announced on August 18 that Iguodala had signed the deal.
On August 19 Philly.com announced that veteran backup big man Theo Ratliff had agreed to terms on veterans league minimum 1 year 1.4 million dollar deal with the 76ers. Ratliff had previously played with Philadelphia from 1997–2001. Ratliff was named an All-Star in 2001, but was unable to play because of an injury.[9]
On September 1, 2008 following his placement on waivers Donyell Marshall agreed to terms with the Philadelphia 76ers for a one-year contract for the league minimum $1,262,275 (for veterans with at least 10 years of experience).  The story was first reported by The Philadelphia Daily News[10]

Playoffs[edit]
First Round[edit]
In the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs, the sixth seeded Philadelphia 76ers were paired with the third seed Southeast Division champions and eventual Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic in a best-of-seven series. The Sixers managed to split the series with the Magic at two games a piece after four games, but the Magic went on to win what would be the final two games of the series to eliminate the Sixers.
