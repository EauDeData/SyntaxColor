History[edit]
In the past, many philanthropists donated land and money towards the building of charitable and religious institutions in Singapore. One such donor was Ahmad Mohamed Salleh Angullia who donated a piece of land (lot 114, mukim XXII), located at the junction of Upper Serangoon Road and Hillside Drive, for the building of a mosque to meet the needs of the Muslims living in the area.[2]
On 21 February 1920, he legally appointed Shaik Omar bin Abdullah Bamadhaj and Haji Mohamad Eusofe to be his contrustees in the management of Masjid Haji Yusoff.[2]
The mosque was built in 1921, occupying an area of 721 square feet (67.0 m2). As time went by, the building could not accommodate all the worshippers from Serangoon, Toa Payoh, Aljunied and neighboring constituencies. More space was needed and in September 1973, the building was extended. A dome was also added. The cost of extension amounted to $35,000 which come from public donations. The extensions took seven months to complete. Besides religious activities and religious knowledge classes, the mosque also organized tuition classes in English Mathematics Arabic and typing.[2]

Transportation[edit]
The mosque is accessible from Kovan MRT station.
