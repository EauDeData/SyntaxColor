The 17th IAAF World Indoor Championships was held from 1 to 4 March 2018 in Birmingham, United Kingdom. This was the city's second hosting of the event as it previously did so in 2003.


== Bidding process ==
Birmingham bid for the 2016 IAAF World Indoor Championships as well as the 2018 event. Portland was selected unanimously to host the 2016 event with Birmingham being the only other bidder. With Portland then out of the running for the 2018 event Birmingham was selected as the host of the 2018 event. The reason Portland was selected for 2016 and Birmingham for 2018 is that the IAAF wanted more time between events in the UK with London hosting the 2012 Summer Olympics as well as the 2017 World Championships in Athletics along with Cardiff hosting the 2016 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships. Portland would become the beginning of a similar sequence for the US, with the 2021 World Championships in Eugene, Oregon and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

== Disqualifications ==
This championship was notable for the large number of disqualifications, primarily lane violations (IAAF rule 163.3(a)). One entire heat of the Men's 400 metres was disqualified, a World Championship first. Some athletes appeared to have difficulty with the steep banking of the track. Accusations were raised about the heavy handedness of the officiating and inconsistencies relative to similar acts committed by star British athletes at the 2017 Outdoor World Championships held in London just 5 and a half months earlier.
